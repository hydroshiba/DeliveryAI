During our course **CSC14003: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** we explored searching problems and how to solve them using various algorithms. This project is a simulation of a deliveryman with the task of delivering packages to customers on a map. The deliveryman has to find the shortest path to arrive at the destination under several constraints including time limit and fuel capacity.
